# flauntbot
Spicy C++ (?? TBC) Telegram bot

Is not yet implemented at all, but here are the proposed implementation details:
- should be totally free and open source
- should run against tdlib or tdlib-json - no middleware
- should absorb many of the media handling functions of its predecessor (this will require python3)
- should integrate most of its predecessor's machine learning abilities (but in native code without python and thrift and everything in the way)
- should include settings or configuration features to avoid collisions with other bots
- will load a conf file from some location at start


Also:
- no commits directly to main branch?
- dev/testing bot should be ditherbot on tg, main should be flauntbot
- investigate: can we add a GUI client of some kind for debugging?
